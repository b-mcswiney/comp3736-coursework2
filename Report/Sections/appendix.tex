\quad We are students at the University of Leeds, interested in how to design visualizations of descriptive statistics. If you volunteer for the experiment you will perform a series of trials. Each trial will show two different graphs of the same type, and your task is to complete each question through basic arithmetic and data analysis. For each question, you would have to chose the answer you think is correct. There is a total of 21 questions.
The experiment will take approximately 15 minutes. Your responses will be recorded, but you will remain anonymous. The research may be reported in student work, but no-one should be able to identify you and at no point will your identity be divulged.
By taking part in the experiment you are indicating informed consent. You are free to withdraw from the experiment at any time. 
Finally, please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss anything with me.
