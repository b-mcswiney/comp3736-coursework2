\section{Conclusion}
\quad In conclusion, we were able to identify the effectiveness of line and area graphs when visualizing information. We found out that area charts were most effective when visualizing totals, whereas line graphs were most effective when visualizing individual variables of the data. By utilizing timestamps, we were also able to gather data and visualize the time taken for each question in the experiment. We were also able to also identify the presence of several outliers through checking correctness. However, we were also able to confirm how the presence of these outliers did not affect our experiment's results. Throughout conducting these experiments, we discovered that each chart type has different insights they excel at displaying to the user.
