\section{Introduction}

\begin{flushleft}
    \quad The purpose of our experiment is to investigate the effectiveness of line and area charts for displaying Olympic medal data.
    For this experiment we used python to create a quiz (further discussed in section two) in order to test how well users can read
    each type of graph. This is measured by asking them to identify differences between two graphs and to perform basic arithmetic
    using the graph. This task of twenty one questions should not take more than twenty minutes for each participant.
    
    \quad Prior to conducting the experiment with each participant, we provided them with necessary information such as no payment being involved, and obtained their consent of using the results for analysis (for further details, refer to section five, participant sheet). The experiment was conducted on fifteen participants, all of them being relatives or friends. Their computer proficiency varied among individuals.
