\section{Introduction}

\begin{flushleft}
    The purpose of our experiment is to investigate the effectiveness of line and area charts for displaying olympic medal data.
    For this experiment we used python to create a quiz (further discussed in section 2) in order to test how well users can read
    each type of graph. This is measured by asking them to identify differences between two graphs and to perform basic arithmetic
    using the graph. This task should only take 15--20 minutes to complete for each user.
