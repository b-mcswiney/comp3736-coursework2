    From figure 2 we can gather insights on the quality of the questions asked to the participants.
    Within this data two major outliers are apparent, these being question eight and fifteen. The low number of 
    correct answers for these questions indicates that there was a mistake made with them. Upon further investigation,
    this proved to be true as the multiple choice answers contained a typo making them impossible to answer. The responses for questions eight and fifteen 
    are still valid with regards to response time, however, as the participants still answered as if there was no typo.

    In comparison to these outliers, the rest of the data is as we expected with the experiment results. Some questions had a few wrong answers which may indicate they were too difficult
    however, they still had enough correct responses as to indicate there were no mistakes made with the questions.

\subsection*{Time Taken}

    To start with, we can see from figure 3 that line graphs are consistently better at identifying individual variables in comparison to identifying totals between variables.
    Furthermore, through questions nine to twelve we can identify that area graphs are faster than line graphs at identifying totals of variables. This is most likely because stacked 
    area charts show cumulative values for their variables. On the other hand, we can gather from questions six and eight that area charts are much slower when identifying variables in the middle of
    the stack. This is most likely due to more calculations needing to be performed to find the value.

\subsection*{Feedback from participants}

    Question twenty-one was implemented out of our personal curiosity as to how our participants felt after the tests were performed.
    From this data we can see that our user's are at a perfect split in which graph type they prefer for this task. This is expected as 
    each graph has strengths and weaknesses that we demonstrated equally throughout this experiment.
    
    Another piece of feedback that was provided about the graphs was due to
