    From figure 2 we can gather insights on the quality of the questions asked to the participants.
    Within this data two major outliers are apparent, these being question eight and fifteen. The low number of 
    correct answers for these questions indicates that there was a mistake made with them. Upon further investigation,
    this proved to be true as the multiple choice answers contained a typo making them impossible to answer. The responses for questions eight and fifteen 
    are still valid with regards to response time, however, as the participants still answered as if there was no typo.

    In comparison to these outliers, the rest of the data is as we expected with the experiment results. Some questions had a few wrong answers which may indicate they were too difficult
    however, they still had enough correct responses as to indicate there were no mistakes made with the questions.
